#  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Prediction Using Machine Learning
Check out the site by  <a href="https://autismprediction27.streamlit.app/"> clicking here </a> <br/>
This project uses **machine learning and Python libraries** to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral and demographic data. A user-friendly **Streamlit web app** allows users to interactively input features and receive a prediction.

##  Problem Statement

Early detection of Autism can lead to timely intervention and improved outcomes. This project builds a predictive model based on the **Autism Screening Adult Dataset**, using behavioral scores and personal information to assess ASD risk.

##  Sample Prediction Workflow

1. User selects answers to 10 behavioral questions (A1â€“A10)  
2. Provides age, gender, and other demographics  
3. Inputs are encoded using stored `LabelEncoders`  
4. Pre-trained model predicts ASD likelihood  
5. Result is shown to user with visual feedback:  
   - ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk  
   - ðŸ”´ High Risk

##  Future Improvements

- Add explainability with SHAP or LIME  
- Integrate additional ML models like SVM, XGBoost for comparison  
- Display confidence probability alongside prediction  
- Deploy the app on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces
